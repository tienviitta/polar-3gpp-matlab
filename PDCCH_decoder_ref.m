function a_hat = PDCCH_decoder_ref(f_tilde, A, L, min_sum, RNTI, tc)
% PDCCH_DECODER Polar decoder for the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) of 3GPP New
% Radio, as defined in Section 7.3 of TS38.212. Implements the zero-
% padding to increase the length of short payloads to 12 bits of Section 7.3.1,
% the Cyclic Redudancy Check (CRC) attachment of Section 7.3.2, the channel
% coding of Section 7.3.3 and the rate matching of Section 7.3.4. Note that
% this code does not implement the DCI bit sequence generation of Section
% 7.3.1.
%   a_hat = PDCCH_DECODER(f_tilde, A, L, min_sum) decodes the encoded LLR sequence
%   f_tilde, in order to obtain the recovered information bit sequence
%   a_hat.
%
%   f_tilde should be a real row vector comprising E number of Logarithmic
%   Likelihood Ratios (LLRS), each having a value obtained as LLR =
%   ln(P(bit=0)/P(bit=1)). The first LLR corresponds to f_0 from Section
%   7.3.4 of TS38.212, while the last LLR corresponds to
%   f_E-1.
%
%   A should be an integer scalar. It specifies the number of bits in the
%   information bit sequence, where A should be in the range 1 to 140.
%
%   L should be a scalar integer. It specifies the list size to use during
%   Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding.
%
%   min_sum shoular be a scalar logical. If it is true, then the SCL
%   decoding process will be completed using the min-sum approximation.
%   Otherwise, the log-sum-product will be used. The log-sum-product gives
%   better error correction capability than the min-sum, but it has higher
%   complexity.
%
%   RNTI should be a binary row vector comprising 16 bits, each having the
%   value 0 or 1. If this parameter is omitted, then ones(1,16) will be
%   used for the RNTI. The first bit corresponds to x_rnti,0 from Section
%   7.3.2 of TS38.212, while the last bit corresponds to x_rnti,15.
%
%   a_hat will be a binary row vector comprising A number of bits, each
%   having the value 0 or 1. The first output bit corresponds to a_0 from
%   Section 7.3.1 of TS38.212, while the last output bit corresponds
%   to a_A-1.
